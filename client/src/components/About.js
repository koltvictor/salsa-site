            Hi!  Let us introduce you to the brains and talent behind the operation: <strong>Gabby</strong>.  Born and raised in Las Vegas, Gabby grew up learning how to cook Mexican meals by helping her mom in the kitchen. She painstakingly learned the ins-and-outs of traditional Mexican cooking and through the years has developed her own flair.  <br />Salsa Verde has always been a traditional part of family meals at Gabby's house and over the years the recipe has been developed into what it is today! Still one of the musts in Gabby's household, she is so thrilled to welcome everyone to bring the recipe into their own family gatherings.  The Red Salsa is the newest addition to Gabby's salsa must-haves.  Savory and delicious, all of Gabby's Salsas are traditional, delectible, and delicious.  Guaranteed to have the freshest ingredients in every batch with <strong>big</strong> flavor!
